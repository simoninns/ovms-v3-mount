# OVMS V3 Mount (Open Vehicle Monitoring System)
## Overview
This project provides a mounting bracket for mounting the OVMS v3 module inside the left-hand glovebox of a Renault Twizy (although the design should work for many vehicles).  The OVMS module is affixed into the blackplate and the GPS and Cellular antenna cables are wrapped around the included cable holder.

All connectors on the OVMS module are accessible with the exception of the 'Diag.' port.

This project is open-source.  You can find the OpenSCAD source here: https://github.com/simoninns/ovms-v3-mount

The OpenSCAD source also includes a mock-up of the actual OVMS module to make modification to the design easier.

## Printing instructions
The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using Prusament PETG filament. All parts fit on a 20x20 printing bed.

### Recommended print settings
Print settings (for Prusa Slicer) are the same for all included parts:

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.30mm
* Infill: 20%
* Supports: No Supports

# Assembly
Start by clipping together the backplate and cable holder parts.  The clips will be stiff, but apply pressure over the clip area until the parts snap together.

The antennas should be affixed using double-sided tape.  The OVMS module can also be held in place with double-sided tape.  It is suggested to mock-up all the part (with the cable wrapped) to make sure everything is OK before sticking the parts in place.
